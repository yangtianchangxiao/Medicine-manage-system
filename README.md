#An aid prescription generate system
Based on Python. This project aims to develop a medicine manage system which enables doctors  generate e-prescription and print them in official format.  
The system can update medicine information (e.g. specification,  model)
This project should be interaction friendly (how?).
If possible, a scaner can be introduced when makeing prescription. It scane patients' IDs and the medicine bought.
The python program should assemble the sicker's base information (name, gender, age), the medicine, timestamp and their doctors' names together.
